# LPC1114
### FORTH development using LPC1114 DIP ARM Chip

The nxp LPC1114 is an ARM processor in a breadboard-friendly 28-pin DIP.

It's easily programmed using a USB-to-Serial cable, and there is a pre-built FORTH image available.

I'm currently exploring the combination and will document the hardware and software in this GitHub
project.

The project was inspired by two great Hackaday articles:

[ARMing a Breadboard](http://hackaday.com/2015/10/09/arming-a-breadboard-everyone-should-program-an-arm/)

[Go Forth on a Breadboard](https://hackaday.com/2015/08/30/go-forth-on-a-breadboard/)
