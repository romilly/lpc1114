# Installing the software

## Context

These instructions assume that you are using a recent Linux Ubuntu or Mint installation.
 
You'll find details of alternatives for Windows or OSX online but I have not tested them.

## Prerequisites

Once you have wired up your breadboard you will need to install `lpc21isp`.


    sudo apt-get install lpc21isp

Next, download the [mecrisp-stellaris archive]().

Extract it to a directory of your choice and change to that directory.
